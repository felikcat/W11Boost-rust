== About
A completely work in progress port to Rust using FLTK.

== Compiling
. `winget install Git.Git -eh; winget install Kitware.CMake -eh`
. Install Rust nightly through https://rustup.rs/[rustup] and ensure the compiler is MSVC. If it asks to "Quick install via the Visual Studio Community installer", do so.
